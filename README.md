## Hangman

Created in 2016, my first game in Python - Hangman. 

## Getting Started

Download Hangman.py and words.txt
Open Hangman.py - right click edit in IDLE 3.5
Press F5 to run/play game.
Program will ask for text document.
Type in 'words.txt'
Program will close if this is typed in incorrectly or there is no text file.
Choose a difficulty; type in "easy" , "intermediate", or "hard" (must be in all lowercase)

(easy - will give a random word from words.txt but blanked out by * and 10 lives
intermediate - will give a random word from words.txt but blanked out by * and 7 lives
hard - will give a random word from words.txt but blanked out by * and 5 lives)

Program will allow you to guess letters; you must guess in UPPER CASE.
If guesses are lowercase letters the program will ask you to try and guess again.
Correct letters will be replace * with the correctly guess letter in the correct place.
Wrongly guessed letter will cause lives to be subtracted by 1.

If all letters are guessed, word will show and you recieve the winning message.  
If you lose all lives you will recieve the losing message.
The winning/losing message is then followed by the program asking if you would like you play again.
In lowercase 'yes' to play gain.
In lowercase 'no' to kill program.
